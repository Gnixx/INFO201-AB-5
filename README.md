### Domain of interest
- **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
  - According to UNICEF, more than a billion children are at risk of falling behind from school due to school closures during COVID-19. To keep students safe, countries have implemented virtual learning. Not only does our domain affect billions of people, but it also seems very relevant to our group, as we are all students pursuing higher education.

- **What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
  - Unesco collected data monitoring school closures globally due to COVID-19 and their impact on learners.
  - Another study conducted by Unesco looked at the total duration of school closures during the pandemic and how this number .
  - A study by the Economic Policy Institute researched how learning and online  instruction during the pandemic has affected engagement, teaching, and learning.
  - The CDC did a study on vaccination coverage among adolescents from the ages 13-17.

- **What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
  - What is the total number of the affected students?
  - What is the percentage of students unenrolled?
  - What is the longest duration of time that students did online learning?
  - What country has the lowest number of affected students?
  - What country has the highest number of affected students?
  - How did students perform during school closures?
  - What did schools do in response to school closures and student performance?
  - How many students are unable to set up online learning platforms? Why?
  - What did we learn from these datasets?
  - How did the situation of vaccination affect the recovery of education?
  - How did changing COVID-19 testing policies affect the number of cases in the US?
  - Which university within Washington state had the highest number of total Covid cases?
  - Which university had the highest number of cases in 2021?
