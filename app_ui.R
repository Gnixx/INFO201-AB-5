  collected is not always what you expect it to be. For example, looking at

  with a higher number of school closures within a certain geographic area.
  However, it was more widespread than me thought. Since China's school closures
  were within the top 20 countries, we expected more East Asian countries
  in the top 20 countries with school closures than were actually listed
  in our chart."),
  p("A second takeaway coming from the Vaccinations dataset was
  more people in both age groups 12-17 and 18-24 had a higher percentage of
  the population taking Dose 1 rather than completing both doses. Within these
  two age groups, it surprised us that the group ages 12-17 had a higher
  percetage of the population getting their first dose."),
  p("A takeaway we had from the Covid-19 testing policy dataset
  was how long testing policy 3 was available to people and how Covid-19
  tests were becoming more readily available to the general population overtime.
  Testing policy 3 allowed for more people to gain access to Covid-19 testing
  which also had an effect on reopenings of schools for each country. However,
  a lot of countries like Austrailia still had more limited testing
  options overtime.")
