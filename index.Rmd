## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
## School Closures
The following chart show the top 20 countries with the longest school closure. We can see that the difference between one country and other are very significant. Even though the pandemic was global issue the action each country implemented was different.

``` {r echo=FALSE}
closure_duration_plot
```


``` {r echo=FALSE}
vacc_trend_chart
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
